<p>Today, one of my folks met a very weird problem and finally he asked me for help. The issue was, when running command "ldd CDNap" on a Solaris 9 server(AP11), following error would show up:</p>
<p><code>AP11: ldd CDNap<br />
ldd: CDNap: execution failed due to signal 9</code></p>
<p>However, when running this command on another Solaris 9 server(ap15), it worked well.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://forums.oracle.com/forums/thread.jspa?threadID=1919581">Weird exec failure</a>, "<strong>My bet is that the program has a rather large BSS segment, and there isn't enough swap to reserve the space. (ldd(1) works by setting up some environment variables, then running the program itself, which is why it would fail)</strong>". To verify this, you can run</p>
<pre>/usr/ccs/bin/size /path/to/program</pre>
<p>To check the free space of swap, you can</p>
<pre>swap -s</pre>
<p>After comparing the swap space and memory of the two Solaris servers, I noticed that the server(AP11) bearing this issue has smaller memory(1GB) and swap space(only 75008k available).</p>
<pre>AP11: swap -l

<p>It seems it's time for such old Solaris servers to retire.</p>
