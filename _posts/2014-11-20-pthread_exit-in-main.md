When using `pthread` for multithreading, most threads call `pthread_exit()` implicitly on return from the thread start routine. Besides, `pthread_exit()` also can be used to terminate the initial process thread in `main()`, leaving other threads to continue operation. The process will go away automatically when the last thread terminates. If you don't care about the process exit status, or if is difficult to know the created thread IDs(e.g. created by third party APIs), you can call 

	pthread_detach(pthread_self());
	pthread_exit(NULL);
	
at the end of the `main()` function. 

However, you must be carefull when using `pthread_exit()` in the main thread. Because after calling `pthread_exit()` and before the process really terminate, the process becomes "zombie" - it still exists even though it is "dead", just like a Unix/Linux process that's terminated but hasn't yet been "reaped" by a `wait` operation. The zombie process may retain most or all of the system resources that it used when running, so it is not a good idea to leave threads in this state for longer than necessary. And obviously, zombie process cannot save you resources! So also don't try `pthread_exit()` for saving CPU and memory.

I also noticed a undocumented problem caused by `pthread_exit()` - it may lead to failure of open procfs(`/proc/`) files! If one of your threads would open `/proc/mounts`(_currently I only find this file will go wrong, and other procfs files like `/proc/cpuinfo` or `/proc/uptime` can be successfully opened_) during its life, and `pthread_exit()` is called after creating these threads in the main thread, you will meet the "Invalid argument" error because of functions like `open("/proc/mounts",'r')`.

Following program demonstrates this problem:

	#include <pthread.h>
	#include <stdio.h>
	#include <stdlib.h>
	#define NUM_THREADS	5
	
	void *PrintHello(void *threadid)
	{
	   long tid;
	   tid = (long)threadid;
	   printf("Hello World! It's me, thread #%ld!\n", tid);
	
	   sleep(10); // sleep sometime
	
	   /* Read file */
	   FILE* fp=fopen("/proc/mounts","r"); // would fail
	   //FILE* fp=fopen("/proc/cpuinfo","r");  // would succeed
	   if(fp==NULL) {
		   fprintf(stderr,"Failed to open file!\n");
	   } else {
		   char line[80];
		   if(fgets(line,80,fp)==NULL)
			   fprintf(stderr,"Failed to read file!\n");
		   else
			   fprintf(stdout,"%s\n",line);
		   fclose(fp);
	   }
	
	   sleep(1200);
	   pthread_exit(NULL);
	}
	
	int main(int argc, char *argv[])
	{
	   pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS];
	   int rc;
	   long t;
	   for(t=0;t<NUM_THREADS;t++){
	     printf("In main: creating thread %ld\n", t);
	     rc = pthread_create(&threads[t], NULL, PrintHello, (void *)t);
	     if (rc){
	       printf("ERROR; return code from pthread_create() is %d\n", rc);
	       exit(-1);
	       }
	     }
	
	   /* Last thing that main() should do */
	   pthread_detach(pthread_self());
	   pthread_exit(NULL);
	}

After building above code, say `pthread_exit_test`, run this program and find the PID of it. Then `cat /proc/<PID>/status`, you will find the process status like

	Name:	pthread_exit_te
	State:	Z (zombie)
	Tgid:	3091
	Pid:	3091
	PPid:	2849
	TracerPid:	0

	Mems_allowed_list:	0
	voluntary_ctxt_switches:	14
	nonvoluntary_ctxt_switches:	1

For the above program, if replace `pthread_exit()` with `pthread_join()` or `while(1) {sleep(120); }`, it would work well. The `while` loop is especially usefull when you don't know the thread id to be joined.

Until now I am still don't know why openning `/proc/mounts` would fail and why openning `/proc/cpuinfo` could succeed in above code. I also tried other system file or link, and found all of them could be successively readed.
