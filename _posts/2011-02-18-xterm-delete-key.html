<p>一个困扰了我很久得问题：xterm中&lt;backspace&gt;或&lt;delete&gt;键无法删除敲错的字符，只能使用Ctrl+H或者VI删除模式，很不方便。操作系统是Red Hat Enterprise Linux 5.5。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Google之后发现这个问题比较普遍，但是很多建议都不能解决问题。最终在<a href="http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/questionanswer.do?admit=109447626+1298028466012+28353475&amp;threadId=1158640">http://forums11.itrc.hp.com/service/forums/questionanswer.do?admit=109447626+1298028466012+28353475&amp;threadId=1158640</a>发现了一个可行的办法：</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>stty erase &lt;backspace&gt;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>当然在设置之前要先用stty -a查看erase=XX是不是已经设置成了&lt;backspace&gt;，即^?。</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>如果不想每次打开一个新的xterm之后都要手动输入stty erase &lt;backspace&gt;，可以在.env中加入</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>stty erase&nbsp;^?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>PS：发现了一个详细解释并彻底解决各种Unix/Linux窗口中&lt;backspace&gt;或&lt;delete&gt;不一致的文章：<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html">http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard.html</a>。转载如下。</p>

<h2><a name="intro">Introduction</a></h2>
</div>
<p>These pages were originally written to address a nagging problem which bothered many people using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>. It has to do with the default behaviour of the BackSpace and Delete keys, which did not behave as expected. The goal of this document was and still is to make [&lt;---] (i.e. the backspace-key on your keyboard) to erase to the left, and make [Delete](i.e. the delete-key) erase under the cursor. It seems all Linux distributions I am aware of have effectively dealt with the issue by now. However still lots of people visit these pages, presumably because the information presented here is applicable to other UNIX flavors and cross-platform environments and applications.</p>
<p>The keymapping problem can be traced back to the time when computers used punched tapes. The only way to correct a wrongly punched character was to punch additional bits in the tape (or rather, punch additional bits _out_ of the tape). Characters with all the bits punched were treated as deleted characters. See 'man ascii' for a list of the ASCII characterset, you'll see that DEL, (octal 177, decimal 127 and hexadecimal 7F) is the one with all the bits punched in (the ASCII code with the highest value). To be able to overwrite a character it is necessary to undo the feed between the characters first. For this the ASCII BS (octal 010, decimal 8, hexadecimal 08) was used. So to erase the last-typed character, you would have to press first BS to move back one character, and then DEL to delete the character. In newer computers either BS or DEL was chosen to move back and delete in one press.</p>
<p>The question to use BS or DEL was (and is...) just a matter of choice, just as different operating systems chose different ways to represent newlines, which was done by first issuing a carriage return (CR) and then a line-feed (LF). UNIX chose ASCII LF (hexadecimal 0A) to do both at the same time, Macintosh chose CR and MS-DOS both. Unfortunately, in the BS-DEL case, Linux ended up with two possibilities.</p>
<p>The essential point in this issue is to go for one way consistently. This page describes a way to consistently use DEL to erase the previous character, the page called&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboardprev.html">The Alternative Way</a>&nbsp;describes a way to consistently use BS. On the latter page there are some tips which may be useful regardless of what approach you take.</p>
<p>Since starting this page in 1997, most distributions have sorted out the issue. Still, some of the fixes/workarounds can be useful when working in a mixed environment, or when working on older systems. And evidently, given the number of hits the page still gets, it's a situation common to more then a few people ;-)</p>
<p>If you miss an application on this page, it's either because the keys are ok in the application ("If it ain't broken, don't fix it"), or because I don't know about it. In either case, don't hesitate to mail me about it.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="term">Terminology</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Throughout this document, [&lt;---] and [Delete] are used to denote the physical keys on the keyboard, the things you actually press to erase characters. There are a few things to keep in mind: ASCII values can be represented in several equivalent ways. This means that ASCII BS is equivalent to 010 in octal, 8 in decimal and 08 in hexadecimal notation. To show that a number is in hexadecimal notation '0x' is put in front of it. Finally it should be noted that BS and DEL are known to applications by their corresponding control sequences. To sum it up:</p>

<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="prob">The problem:</a></h2>
</div>
<p>The reason the keys (generally) do not work out-of-the-box is partly lack of configuration (as you will see later, simply creating&nbsp;<code>.inputrc/.cshrc</code>&nbsp;already helps a lot) and a more difficult issue which I will try to describe below.</p>
<p>The linux console emulates a vt220 terminal which has the following key-mapping:</p>
<pre><a name="vt220">Linux console/VT220</a>
Key            KeySymName       Console characters
  --------------------------------------------------
  Ctrl+H   ---&gt;  Control_H  ---&gt;  ASCII  BS (0x08)
  [&lt;---]   ---&gt;  Backspace  ---&gt;  ASCII DEL (0x7f)
  [Delete] ---&gt;  Delete     ---&gt;  "/e[3~"
</pre>
<p>Note 1: BS (0x08) is equivalent to ^H, which is left to be used by applications (e.g. for help menus in emacs, but it could be anything). DEL is equivalent to ^?, or 0177 (octal) and 0x7f (hex) and "/e[3~" will show up in your xterm (using the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#trick">^v-trick</a>) as ^[[3~. Xterms on the other hand, emulate the vt100 terminal, which didn't have a [Delete]. It did have a [&lt;---] which generated ASCII BS (but it was in an awkward position and did not serve as rubout).</p>
<pre>VT100
--
Key            KeySymName       Console characters
  --------------------------------------------------
  Ctrl+H   ---&gt;  Control_H  ---&gt;  ASCII  BS (0x08)
  [&lt;---]   ---&gt;  Backspace  ---&gt;  ASCII DEL (0x7F)
</pre>
<p>Now here's how xterm emulates the VT100 terminal:</p>
<pre><a name="vt100">Xterm's emulation of VT100</a>
Key            KeySymName       Console characters
  --------------------------------------------------
  Ctrl+H   ---&gt;  Control_H  ---&gt;  ASCII  BS (0x08)
  [&lt;---]   ---&gt;  Backspace  ---&gt;  ASCII BS (0x08)
  [Delete] ---&gt;  Delete     ---&gt;  ASCII DEL (0x7F)
</pre>
<p>It may be clear that by default the keys are mapped differently on the console and in xterm. This would be ok if it weren't for the fact that while on the console ^H is free to be used by applications, in an xterm it is not (instead it's mapped to the [&lt;---] key). Differences between terminal types are generally dealt with by the terminfo database (see below), mapping terminal specific strings to the correct key. However, in this case, the ^H should&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;be mapped. Terminfo is not enough, the settings of the terminal (xterm) have to be modified such that ^H is not used.</p>
<p>In&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboardprev.html">my previous attempt</a>&nbsp;at working around the problem, I put most of my effort in trying to map all keys to suit xterm's vt100 emulation. However, I now propose another way to deal with the problem. This basically means getting xterm to work with the consoles' default settings: [&lt;---] will do ASCII DEL (0x7F, or ^?), and [Delete] will do "/e[3~". This way ^H is not used for any terminal specific functions, it can be used by applications.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="sol">Solution (work-arounds)</a></h2>
</div>
<p>There is no clear solution, but there are some pretty good work-arounds. What is needed is to tell&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#Xterm">xterm</a>&nbsp;how to handle the keys, and then to tell other applications about it (i.e. how xterm handles the keys). The terminfo database contains descriptions of how all kinds of terminals handle (terminal specific) keys. Applications look at the TERM variable, and then search the corresponding database for the value of a certain key, e.g. the left-arrow key, and find the string that corresponds to it. This means that the strings in the database had better correspond to your current xterm settings. This involves modifying xterm's terminfo entry.</p>
<p>When you change the keymapping on your own system, you may have problems when accessing other systems. Luckily, this can be worked-around by a script which changes the input it receives to the output that is expected by the application (telnet, rlogin). See the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#other">telnet</a>&nbsp;section.</p>

<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="terminfo">Terminfo</a></h2>
</div>
<p>This is often a problem. When you find that the keys are fine in e.g. vi on the console, but not in an xterm (or vice versa, or both) it means that your xterm-settings do not correspond to the settings listed in the terminfo database. I am not really comfortable with telling you to fiddle with terminfo, please be careful, make backups! If you run the tic command on the modified de-compiled terminfo entry as root, your system's terminfo database will be modified automagically. Put the original file in a save place so you can run tic on it and restore the original state. Read the manpage. First try it as non-privileged user. You can start with testing a modified xterminfo file (see below) as explained, however, since these are likely to differ from your system's entry at other points, it's probably better to modify your own instead. At any rate, first find out whether the terminfo entry for xterm is in accordance with your xterm settings:</p>
<pre><code>infocmp | grep kbs</code>
</pre>
<p>should return a line which includes&nbsp;<code>kbs=/177</code>. This means DEL (or ^?) is mapped to the backspace key, which is what we want.</p>
<pre><code>infocmp | grep kdch1</code>
</pre>
<p>should return a line with&nbsp;<code>kdch1=/E[3~</code>. This means that /E[3~ is mapped to the delete key. Often you will find kbs=^H and/or kdch1=/177, or there will be no kdch1 at all. You can either edit the terminfo entry as described on the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/troubleshooting.html#termcap">Troubleshooting-page</a>&nbsp;(simply setting or adding&nbsp;<code>kdch1=/E[3~</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>kbs=/177</code>, but make a backup first!). Put the file in&nbsp;<code>~/.terminfo/x/xterm</code>&nbsp;(for testing purposes) and do for bash:</p>
<pre><code>export TERMINFO=~/.terminfo</code>
</pre>
<p>and/or for tcsh:</p>
<pre><code>setenv TERMINFO ~/.terminfo</code>
</pre>
<p>Make sure that the TERM variable is set to xterm:</p>
<pre><code>echo $TERM</code>
</pre>
<p>should return "xterm". If it works as intended (do 'toe' to check whether the terminfo dir you specified is indeed used, toe will return a list of available terminfo types, only xterm in this case), you can run tic as root, which will copy the file to</p>
<pre><code>/etc/terminfo/x/xterm</code>
</pre>
<p>(<a href="http://www.debian.org/">debian</a>) or</p>
<pre><code>/usr/lib/terminfo/x/xterm</code>
</pre>
<p>(<a href="http://www.redhat.com/">redhat</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cdrom.com/">slackware</a>). Make backups first, and test it before you replace any files!</p>
<hr />
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="Xterm">Xterm</a></h2>
</div>
<p>The xterm (and friends) only needs little configuration. In the&nbsp;<code>/etc/X11/Xresources</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>~/.Xdefaults</code>&nbsp;(or wherever it's merged with the other xresources) add the line:</p>
<pre><code>*VT100.Translations: #override /
              &lt;Key&gt;BackSpace: string(0x7F)/n/
              &lt;Key&gt;Delete:    string("/033[3~")/n/
              &lt;Key&gt;Home:      string("/033[1~")/n/
              &lt;Key&gt;End:       string("/033[4~")
*ttyModes: erase ^? 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Rxvt only uses&nbsp;<code>Xresources</code>&nbsp;if it is compiled with this option. Since rxvt uses readline, to get home and end to work you will have to edit&nbsp;<code>.inputrc</code>, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#Bash">Bash</a>&nbsp;section).&nbsp;<a href="http://www.redhat.com/"><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0 goog_qs-tidbit-hilite">Redhat</span></a><span class="goog_qs-tidbit goog_qs-tidbit-0 goog_qs-tidbit-hilite">&nbsp;users can pick up the SRPM (source) and compile rxvt themselves</span>&nbsp;with this&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/feature.h">feature.h</a>, ensuring the right keybindings.</p>
<p>Putting&nbsp;<code>xterm</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>nxterm</code>&nbsp;in front of&nbsp;<code>*vt100.translations</code>&nbsp;makes the settings specific for xterm or nxterm. Sometimes this does not seem to work properly, in that case try using both<code>nxterm*VT100.Translations</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>xterm*VT100.Translations</code>.</p>
<p><a name="trick">BTW, have I told you that&nbsp;<code>Ctrl-v &lt;key&gt;</code>&nbsp;will tell you what sequence is sent to the shell? Try&nbsp;<code>Ctrl-v [Delete]</code>, it should give a&nbsp;<code>^[[3~</code>&nbsp;in your xterm or console (try it with [ESC] and you'll find ^[, which corresponds to /e for readline apps, and /033 for Xresources).</a></p>
<p>1. The syntax of the&nbsp;<code>Xresources</code>&nbsp;files is very strict, make sure you don't leave blank spaces after the backslash on each line. Also watch the newline (<code>/n/</code>) sequences, there shouldn't be one at the last line of an entry.<br />2. The sections are named, if you only use&nbsp;<code>*VT100.Translations</code>&nbsp;it will work for all xterm and friends.<br />3. For info about&nbsp;<code>Xresources</code>&nbsp;and other X related stuff refer to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/X.html"><code>'man X'</code></a>.</p>
<hr />
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="X">X</a></h2>
</div>
<p>If you use&nbsp;<a href="http://www.xfree86.org/">XFree86</a>, make sure you have enable the XKB extensions in&nbsp;<code>/etc/X11/XF86Config</code>. It is enable by default, so it should be okay. Note the different keyboard layout-options. Now XFree86 will translate the console mapping, and everything should work in X. If you have problems, or want to fiddle with additional characters and things, create an&nbsp;<code>Xmodmap</code>. Also if you want the keyboard to generate special characters in X,&nbsp;<code>xmodmap</code>&nbsp;can also be used to configure the function-keys. This is adequately described in the manual page (<code>'man xmodmap'</code>. Make sure that the following lines are included in your<code>Xmodmap</code>:</p>
<p><code>keycode 22 = BackSpace</code><br /><code>keycode 107 = Delete</code></p>
<p>Note that the keycodes in X are&nbsp;<strong>not</strong>&nbsp;the same as in a VT. Use&nbsp;<code>showkey</code>&nbsp;to see the keycodes generated by the keyboard in a VT, and&nbsp;<code>xev</code>&nbsp;in X. There is an excellent graphical front end for X-keyboard configuration:&nbsp;<code>xkeycaps</code>. Refer to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#netscape">Netscape section</a>.</p>
<p>Another way of generating special characters in X (without using&nbsp;<code>xmodmap</code>) is by defining a Compose-key (for use as a "dead key") in&nbsp;<code>XF86Config</code>&nbsp;in the Keyboard section:</p>
<pre><code>  RightCtl        Compose
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now you have a compose-key with the same properties as the one described in the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboardprev#VT">VT</a>&nbsp;section. Remember to set the environment variable&nbsp;<code>LC_CTYPE=iso-8859-1</code>&nbsp;(see&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboardprev.html#VTopt">VT optional...</a>). Consult&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/XF86Config.man.html"><code>'man XF86Config'</code></a>&nbsp;if you want to know more.&nbsp;<strong>Note</strong>: this doesn't seem work rxvt.<br />Alternatively, owners of a windows keyboard (one with extra buttons, it need not be a M$ natural keyboard) can enable the&nbsp;<code>XKEYBOARD</code>&nbsp;extension (enabled per default) in&nbsp;<code>XF86Config</code>&nbsp;and uncomment the line (follow the instructions in the file):</p>
<pre><code>  XkbModel    "microsoft" 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now you can use the button with the windows flag on it to produce a great number of exotic characters, just press it in combination with e.g. a, producing &aacute; (a clear disadvantage is that there is no logic in the location of the special characters at all...).</p>
<p>Yet another way to use "dead keys" in X is by installing a modified version of libX11 which includes support for dead keys (transparent for all apps). First, get the modified version of libX11 (make sure you get the right version, if you use glibc replace both libX11, ELF-libc5 and ELF-libc6). Now, deactivate the XKB extension of XFree86 (edit&nbsp;<code>XF86Config</code>&nbsp;and run xmodmap on a Xmodmap file with dead keys like dead_acute, dead_grave, dead_cedilla, dead_ogonek and a Multi_keys one too.</p>
<p>A special case is if you use xdm, you need to deactivate XKB from the&nbsp;<code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xservers</code>&nbsp;file, passing a -kb parameter to the server like this:</p>
<pre><code>:0 local /usr/X11R6/bin/X -kb
</code>
</pre>
<p>then in&nbsp;<code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code>&nbsp;file add a line to load the Xmodmap, like this:</p>
<pre><code>if [ -r /etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap ]; then
        /usr/X11R6/bin/xmodmap /etc/X11/xinit/.Xmodmap
fi
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now chars accesible by AltGr, dead keys or compose are usable in xdm too.</p>
<h4>More Composing Talk</h4>
<p>A problem common to all compose schemes is that while some composing systems make more sense than others, none of them make all of the iso_8859_1 characters readily accessible, simply because it is impossible to remember the combinations for all characters. So instead of, or in addition to getting special libraries, it is often desirable to simply have a list of characters you can copy from, a poor man's iso_8859_1 table so to speak. Just grab you favorite editor, open a file called iso_8859_1 (or any other name, but check the name and path) and put in all iso_8859_1 characters. Wait, here they are (you may want to create a different order):</p>
<pre><code>&iexcl; &cent; &pound; &curren; &yen; &brvbar; &sect; &uml; &copy; &ordf; &laquo; &not; &shy; &reg; &macr; &deg; &plusmn; &amp;sup2; &amp;sup3; &acute; &micro; &para; &middot; &cedil; &amp;sup1; &ordm; &raquo; &amp;frac14; &amp;frac12; &amp;frac34; &iquest; &Agrave; &Aacute; &Acirc; &Atilde; &Auml; &Aring; &AElig; &Ccedil;
&Egrave; &Eacute; &Ecirc; &Euml; &Igrave; &Iacute; &Icirc; &Iuml; &ETH; &Ntilde; &Ograve; &Oacute; &Ocirc; &Otilde; &Ouml; &times; &Oslash; &Ugrave; &Uacute; &Ucirc; &Uuml; &Yacute; &THORN; &szlig; &agrave; &aacute; &acirc; &atilde; &auml; &aring; &aelig; &ccedil; &egrave; &eacute; &ecirc; &euml; &igrave; &iacute; &icirc;
&iuml; &eth; &ntilde; &ograve; &oacute; &ocirc; &otilde; &ouml; &divide; &oslash; &ugrave; &uacute; &ucirc; &uuml; &yacute; &thorn; &yuml; 
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now you need a way to display them (millions of options here, I bet you can do all kinds of crazy things with fonts, colors, pixmaps, borders...). The script assumes the file with the characters is in<code>/usr/local/lib</code>.</p>
<pre><code> 

#!/bin/bash 
export LESSCHARSET=latin1 
exec xterm -T Iso_8859_1-TABLE -geometry 77x4 +sb -bg SteelBlue -fg white /
-fn lucidasanstypewriter-bold-12 -e less /usr/local/lib/iso_8859_1

</code>
</pre>
<p>Refer to the manual page of iso_8859_1. If you do 'man iso_8859_1' but you don't see any special characters, edit&nbsp;<code>/etc/man.config</code>, and change the following line:</p>
<pre><code>NROFF         /usr/bin/groff -Tascii -mandoc
</code>
</pre>
<p>to:</p>
<pre><code>NROFF         /usr/bin/groff -Tlatin1 -mandoc
</code>
</pre>
<p>Now try 'man -c iso_8859_1' (the -c option is to make sure man does not use an old cat file).</p>

<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="Bash">Bash</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Create a file,&nbsp;<code>/etc/inputrc</code>&nbsp;for system wide use or&nbsp;<code>~/.inputrc</code>&nbsp;for personal use. Actually, this is the readline initialization file, readline is a library that some programs (bash, kvt) use to read input (try&nbsp;<code>bind -v</code>&nbsp;to see a list of readline key and function bindings). Cut and paste the following in the file to make the Delete key delete characters under the cursor, and make Home and End work as well:</p>
<pre><code>"/e[3~": delete-char
# this is actually equivalent to "/C-?": delete-char
# VT
"/e[1~": beginning-of-line
"/e[4~": end-of-line
# kvt
"/e[H":beginning-of-line
"/e[F":end-of-line
# rxvt and konsole (i.e. the KDE-app...)
"/e[7~":beginning-of-line
"/e[8~":end-of-line
</code>
</pre>
<p>If a system-wide&nbsp;<code>/etc/inputrc</code>&nbsp;was created, add the following line to&nbsp;<code>/etc/profile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>export INPUTRC=/etc/inputrc</code>
</pre>
<p>Make sure that the stty erase character is set to&nbsp;<code>^?</code>. Type</p>
<pre><code>stty -a | grep erase</code>
</pre>
<p>and check if it says</p>
<pre><code>erase = ^?;</code>
</pre>
<p>If it is set to something else (e.g.&nbsp;<code>^H</code>) then put the following line in both&nbsp;<code>.bashrc</code>&nbsp;and in either&nbsp;<code>.bash_profile</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>/etc/profile</code>:</p>
<pre><code>  if tty --quiet ; then
    stty erase '^?'
  fi
</code>
</pre>
<p>and for xterm and rxvt add this to&nbsp;<code>.Xdefaults</code>:</p>
<pre><code>*ttyModes: erase ^?
</code>            
</pre>
<p>If you create&nbsp;<code>/etc/inputrc</code>, note that Bash will ignore&nbsp;<code>~/.inputrc</code>&nbsp;(currently this happens in all distributions except Debian, however, this might change in the future). As an alternative, you can edit<code>~/.inputrc</code>, and copy this to&nbsp;<code>/etc/skel/</code>, so it's in the home directories of all new users.<br />Push the key-combination '<code>Ctrl-x-r</code>' (push the control-key, the x-key. release it, push the r-key, release it, and then release the control-key) to see if the changes in&nbsp;<code>inputrc</code>&nbsp;take effect. Or just login again, and it will work.</p>
<p>You can also change the keybindings on the fly with the&nbsp;<code>bind</code>&nbsp;command, e.g:</p>
<pre>[localhost]&gt; bind "/C-?": backward-delete-char
</pre>
<p>This is useful to test different keybindings, if they work you can put them in&nbsp;<code>~/.inputrc</code>. Read all about it in the readline manpage.</p>
<p>People using keymaps with e.g. Scandinavian characters who would like bash to display these characters (&oslash;l;-) have to add the following lines in&nbsp;<code>.inputrc</code>:<br /><code>set convert-meta off</code><br /><code>set output-meta on</code><br /><code>set input-meta on</code></p>

<p>If you use the tcsh shell, put the following lines in your&nbsp;<code>/etc/cshrc</code>&nbsp;or your personal&nbsp;<code>~/.cshrc file:</code></p>
<pre><code>#.cshrc
 if ($term == "xterm" || $term == "vt100" /

<h2><a name="athena">Athena Applications</a></h2>
</div>
<p>For programs using the Athena widgets (xpaint, xbmbrowser, xman, xmh, xedit, pixmap, bitmap, editres...) put the following in&nbsp;<code>.Xdefaults</code>&nbsp;to get Delete to work:</p>
<pre><code>*Text.translations:    #override / 
    ~Shift ~Meta &lt;Key&gt;Delete: delete-next-character()
</code>
</pre>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="emacs">Emacs</a></h2>
</div>
<p>In emacs, [&lt;---] and [Delete] are by default configured to both erase the character on the left of the cursor. To change this, you can either edit the file&nbsp;<code>x-win.el</code>&nbsp;in the emacs root directory, and find the following:</p>
<pre><code>
;; Map certain keypad keys into ASCII characters
;; that people usually expect.
(define-key function-key-map [backspace] [127])
(define-key function-key-map [delete] [127])

</code>
</pre>
<p>and change the last line to</p>
<pre><code>(define-key function-key-map [delete] [deletechar])

</code>
</pre>
<p>Alternatively you can add</p>
<pre><code>(define-key function-key-map [delete] [deletechar])

</code>
</pre>
<p>to your ~/.emacs file. On a related note, by default in emacs the HOME key brings you to the beginning of the buffer (i.e. top of the document). Likewise the END key brings you to the end of the buffer. Adding the lines</p>
<pre><code>
(define-key global-map [home] `beginning-of-line)
(define-key global-map [end] `end-of-line)
</code>
</pre>
<p>to your&nbsp;<code>~/.emacs</code>&nbsp;make these keys move you to the beginning and end of the current line. Note that the M-&lt; and M-&gt; keybindings remain untouched and can still be used to go to the beginning and end of the buffer.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="joe">Joe</a></h2>
</div>
<p>First find the file joerc. It is most likely&nbsp;<code>/usr/lib/joe/joerc</code>, but sometimes&nbsp;<code>/etc/joerc</code>, or maybe even&nbsp;<code>/usr/local/lib/joerc</code>. Try&nbsp;<code>'locate joerc'</code>&nbsp;if you can't find the file. Make a backup for safety, or copy it to .joerc in your home directory, and change/add the following lines in the section "Standard JOE user interface" in joerc:</p>
<pre><code>bol              ^[ [ H          # Standard xterm escape seq.
bol              ^[ [ 1 ~        # Standard VT escape seq.
bol              ^[ [ 7 ~        # rxvt
eol              ^[ [ F          # Standard xterm escape seq.
eol              ^[ [ 4 ~        # Standard VT escape seq.
eol              ^[ [ 8 ~        # rxvt
</code>
</pre>
<p><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;that you first have to make sure that Home and End work in an&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#Xterm">xterm</a>. Check out&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/joe.html"><code>'man joe'</code></a>. BTW, these modifications apply to&nbsp;<code>jpicorc</code>,&nbsp;<code>jstarrc</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>jmacsrc</code>&nbsp;as well.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="kde">KDE</a></h2>
</div>
<p><a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE</a>&nbsp;provides a new alternative to kvt called konsole. To get the home/end keys to work in konsole you have to put:</p>
<pre> 
<code>"/e[H":beginning-of-line
"/e[F":end-of-line
</code>
</pre>
<p>in&nbsp;<code>.inputrc</code>. Additionally, make sure that you have checked the '<code>BS sends DEL</code>' checkbox (right mouse click, or through the 'Options' pulldown menu). In kvt,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.kde.org/">KDE's</a>&nbsp;home and end can be configured by editing&nbsp;<code>~/.inputrc</code>&nbsp;(<code>tcsh</code>&nbsp;users too, it uses readline):</p>
<pre> 
<code>"/e[H":beginning-of-line
"/e[F":end-of-line
</code>
</pre>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="less">Less</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Less is ok on some systems. If it is not on yours, try the following. Create a file,&nbsp;<code>/etc/lesskey</code>, for system-wide use. This will be a&nbsp;<code>lesskey</code>&nbsp;input file. Put the following lines in the file:</p>
<pre><code>#line-edit
/e[3~          delete
/e[1~          home
/e[4~          end
</code>
</pre>
<p>Save the file, and compile it as follows:</p>
<pre><code>[localhost]&gt; lesskey -o /etc/less /etc/lesskey</code>
</pre>
<p>Add the following line to /etc/profile:</p>
<pre><code>export LESS="-MM -k/etc/less"</code>
</pre>
<p>Now type:</p>
<p><code>[localhost]&gt; . /etc/profile</code></p>
<p>By fiddling with these settings you should be able to get less to accept (all of) the holy keycodes, at least, it works on my computer. For some exciting reading, check&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/lesskey.html"><code>'man lesskey'</code></a>.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="nedit">Nedit</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Put the following in&nbsp;<code>~/.Xdefaults</code>:</p>
<pre><code> nedit.remapDeleteKey: False</code>
</pre>
<p>Save the file, and the next time you start&nbsp;<a href="http://www-pat.fnal.gov/nirvana/nedit.html">nedit</a>&nbsp;the Delete key will do what we want it to: delete under the cursor. Note: you can also put the line in&nbsp;<code>~/.nedit</code>, but every time you save the default settings, the<code>.nedit</code>&nbsp;file will be overwritten, and you'll have to (n)edit it again.</p>
<p>Note the nedit, as e.g. netscape, is a motif application. This means that it uses the XKeysymDB, see thet netscape section.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="netscape">Netscape</a></h2>
</div>
<p>The keys should be ok, as long as the XKeysymDB is installed in one of the places where netscape looks (where netscape itself is installed, or&nbsp;<code>/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/</code>). XKeysymDB is similar to an xmodmap file, but with a very cryptic and poorly documented syntax. Luckily, it does do the delete/backspace thing right, so no sweat.</p>
<p>If you use xmodmap, you may want to check out the graphical front end for X-keyboard configuration:&nbsp;<code>xkeycaps</code>. Get the .rpm at&nbsp;<a href="ftp://ftp.redhat.com/pub/redhat/">RedHat Powertools</a>, or get the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.debian.org/Packages/stable/x11/xkeycaps.html">Debian-package</a>&nbsp;(or plain tarball). It's a nice tool. You can also look for a default Xmodmap file on your system. At any rate, make sure that the following is in the file:</p>
<p><code>keycode 22 = BackSpace<br />keycode 107 = Delete</code></p>
<p>alternatively, you can put it in e.g. your .Xclients file, or in&nbsp;<code>/etc/X11/xdm/Xsetup_0</code>):</p>
<pre><code># map the [&lt;---] key to the [BackSpace] keysym.
xmodmap -e "keycode 22 = BackSpace"
# map the [Delete] key to the [Delete] keysym.
xmodmap -e "keycode 107 = Delete"
</code>
</pre>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="pico">Pico and Pine</a></h2>
</div>
<p>I found that while the keys worked in a VT, in xterms only backspace works. This was caused by the&nbsp;<code>.Xdefaults</code>&nbsp;modifications. If you use the&nbsp;<code>~/.inputrc</code>&nbsp;to get Delete to work in xterms (and then pico and pine will be able to use Delete), however, this creates problems with other apps (e.g. joe) which cannot be easily solved because joe relies on the&nbsp;<code>.Xdefaults</code>&nbsp;modifications to get the keys right. Anyway, it turns out that&nbsp;<a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">pine</a>&nbsp;and pico are simply broken, as the workaround will clearly demonstrate. Admittedly broken is a relative thing in all this keyboard-confusion: from the other method's perspective they are perfectly ok. One thing is for sure, these two apps are exceptions. Try the following: make an expect script (let's call it picofix):</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect

eval spawn -noecho $argv

interact {
 /177        {send "/010"}
 "/033/[3~"  {send "/004"}
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>Make picofix executable, and start the editor (or pine) with</p>
<pre><code>picofix pico</code>
</pre>
<p>and it will work (then you can make an alias or a wrapper). Thanks to Philip Hands for this ingenious (and powerful!) workaround. You can also use an alternate editor. Edit&nbsp;<code>.pinerc</code>&nbsp;and find the following lines:</p>
<p><code># Specifies the program invoked by ^_ in the Composer,<br /># or the "enable-alternate-editor-implicitly" feature.<br />editor=</code></p>
<p>You can enter the command for any editor here, e.g.&nbsp;<code>joe</code>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<code>vi</code>.</p>
<p>If you want the editor to be started right away, start&nbsp;<code>pine</code>, enter&nbsp;<code>SETUP</code>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<code>Config</code>&nbsp;and select the&nbsp;<code>enable-alternate-editor-implicitly</code>&nbsp;option. Now the editor of choice will be started automagically when you start writing a message.</p>
<p>Pico fans may want to try jpico, which is basically joe with pico keybindings (and all the extra's joe offers). Others my be even smarter and switch to&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vim.org/">vim</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt</a>. Note that the first can be taught to do the<code>Ctrl-j</code>-trick, the latter can use pine keybindings.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="vim">Vim</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Vim uses&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#terminfo">terminfo</a>, so the keys should be ok if your terminfo is. However, if it is not, you can still get the keys to work in vim. Type&nbsp;<code>:help fixdel</code>&nbsp;in vim and read all about it.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="mutt">Mutt</a></h2>
</div>
<p>Put the following line in&nbsp;<code>~/.muttrc</code>:</p>
<pre>bind editor &lt;delete&gt; delete-char
</pre>
<p>This will make [Delete] do its job in&nbsp;<a href="http://www.mutt.org/">mutt's</a>&nbsp;internal pager.</p>
<div class="c3">
<h2><a name="other">Telnet</a></h2>
</div>
<p>If you have modified&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#terminfo">terminfo</a>&nbsp;and you are e.g. telnetting to a machine with a default terminfo (for xterm usually), you can use the following script (let's call it kbdfix) to change the keysequences you generate to the ones the program expects:</p>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/expect

eval spawn -noecho $argv

interact {
 /177        {send "/010"}
 "/033/[3~"  {send "/177"}
}
</code>
</pre>
<p>If you press [&lt;---], expect will receive /177 (equivalent to 0x7F and ^?, see the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ibb.net/~anne/keyboard/keyboard.html#vt220">VT220 table</a>) and it will send /010 (equivalent to ^H) along to telnet, which will result in [&lt;---] at the other end. Make it executable and use&nbsp;<code>kbdfix telnet brokenhost</code>. Thanks to Philip Hands for this clever workaround.</p>
<p>The logical next step is to automate the trick. Create a file,&nbsp;<code>/etc/broken-backspace-hosts</code>&nbsp;(or a shorter name...). In this file, list the hosts which expect ^H and ^? instead of ^? and ^[[3~. Now you can make a wrapper for telnet as shown below. This particular script assumes that the telnet binary has been renamed telnet.orig, and that the kbdfix script described in the previous section is somewhere in your path):</p>
<pre><code>
#!/bin/sh

if [ "$#" -ge 1 ]; then
        if grep -wq "$@" /etc/broken-backspace-hosts ; then
                exec kbdfix telnet.orig "$@"
        else
                exec telnet.orig "$@"
        fi
else
        exec telnet.orig
fi

</code>
</pre>
<p>From now on, when you use telnet, the script will check whether the host you are telnetting to is considered broken (listed in the /etc/broken-backspace-hosts file). If it is, the expect script (kbdfix) will be used, if not, telnet will be started directly. Without arguments the original telnet executable will run (thanks to Jason Bonser for this addition). You can do the same for rlogin, although rlogin can't be moved (i.e. won't work when it isn't called rlogin).</p>
