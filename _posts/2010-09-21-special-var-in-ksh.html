<p>The meaning of $* and $@ is identical when not quoted or when used as a<br />
parameter assignment value or as a file name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, when used as a command argument, "$*" is equivalent to "$1<span class="docEmphasis">d</span>$2<span class="docEmphasis">d</span>..." , where <span class="docEmphasis">d</span> is the first character of the <span class="docEmphStrong">IFS</span> parameter, whereas "$@" is equivalent to "$1"<br />
"$2" ....</p>
