<p>By default mex file cannot be executed in parallel in Matlab, which will be a major bottleneck for Matlab program. Fortunately, there is a way to execute loop operations in parallel -- <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/parfor.html">parfor</a>. Matlab provides a good tutorial on parfor: <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/help/distcomp/getting-started-with-parfor.html">Getting Started with parfor</a>.</p>
<p>One tricky problem with parfor is dealing with reduction assignments, which means the value of some variables are updated by each iteration, such as assignment to an array/matrix indexed by loop index.  My suggestion is to separate the loop into two parts: one part deal with non-reduction assignment with <code>parfor</code>, and the other part do the reduction assignment with traditional <code>for</code> loop.</p>
<p>If you cannot save all the <code>parfor</code>-assigned variables in memory, then you must save them into mat file and load them in the next for-loop. In the <code>parfor</code>-loop, command "<code>save</code>" cannot  be used directly because it violates the transparency(God knows what does it mean!). As an alternative, you can create a wrapper function of <code>save</code> and call that function instead. FOr example:</p>
<p>Save the following as "parsave.m":<br />
<code>function parsave(fname, x,y)<br />
save(fname, 'x', 'y')<br />
end<br />
</code><br />
Then run it with:<br />
<code>parfor ii = 1:4<br />
x = rand(10,10);<br />
y = ones(1,3);<br />
parsave(sprintf('output%d.mat', ii), x, y);<br />
end</code></p>
