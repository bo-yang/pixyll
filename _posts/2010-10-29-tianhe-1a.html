A Chinese research center has made the world's faster super computer &mdash; named as Tianhe-1A, which was released at a national conference on high-performance computers (HPC) in China. Made at a cost of over $88 million, Tianhe-1A is theoretically able to do more than 1 quadrillion calculations per second (one petaflop) at peak speed. Tianhe-1A 's peak performance reaches 1.206 petaflops, and it runs at 563.1 teraflops (1,000 teraflops is equal to one petaflop) on the Linpack benchmark."</span></p>

<li id="zw-12bf62e941aPDMvMg3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e941a_tcYVd3916c">Sadly, China needed to build this computer simply to calculate the interest on the US debt in realtime. 【这哥们肯定是美国人】</span></li>
<li id="zw-12bf62e941bEOGmUt3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e941bMP5pKv3916c">Competitive in what, exactly? We have many supercomputers in the USA; we have no idea what to do with them, though, and many of them are spending a lot of time idle. Some supercomputers are now being rented out to investors, because the people the computers were built for -- the scientists -- are not using enough computer time. 【美国的HPC真的多的用不了了？貌似不是吧&hellip;&hellip;模拟一次军事演习或者核爆，就需要N多HPC。不过这哥们的评论要是把USA改成景德镇，那倒是无可争辩的事实&mdash;&mdash;想想研究生期间实验室里闲置了好几年的好几台IBM服务器，买了之后就没人动过它们&hellip;&hellip;】</span></li>
<p id="zw-12bf62e941buEYRKn3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e941cV0pU83916c">What we really need to do is look at the state of research in this country.【这句话说到点子上了。】 Also, maybe if we had a more solid economic base, one in which we solve the trade imbalance by exporting real goods rather than copyrights, we could spend more money on science and supercomputing. Oh well, in your words, "who am I kidding?" 【这句话就说明上段评论是酸葡萄心理了。】</span></p>

<li>Oh my. When have I heard this before? Oh yes, back in the 1980s when there was panic and hyperbole over Japan, Inc. overtaking the USA in everything. How did that pan out exactly? I don't see how the current situation with China is any different. 【严重同意这位美国哥们的观点】</li>
<li id="zw-12bf62e941eAb7jw_3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e941eLorx_13916c">另一哥们对上条评论的回复：</span></li>
<p id="zw-12bf62e941f6PKvln3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e941fx2ST93916c">China is way different from Japan. For starters, it has resources, and it can play the game any way it wants to. Japan could only play hardball (</span><span id="zw-12bf62e941fqbYpPj3916c">采取强硬态度</span><span id="zw-12bf62e941fbe67lL3916c">)&nbsp;economically. China can at any time choose to overrun Korea and Taiwan at any time if they choose to, and the only recourse would either be a hard fought conventional war, or a nuclear exchange.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p id="zw-12bf62e941flTXoAn3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e9420RngW13916c">China can fight dirty(下黑手). Japan cannot. And China is good at fighting dirty, because they "won" two wars (Korea and Vietnam) by proxy, sending in men and materials to do what the native population couldn't. If China chose to, they could easily turn up the heat in other areas hostile to the US by sending in troops and munitions. China could hand Iran the tools to seize control of the Strait of Hormuz and there would be nothing the US could do about it except engage in another theater of war which would be unwinnable. 【看来这哥们对景德镇政府的成见很深啊】</span></p>

<li id="zw-12bf62e9423twMN0K3916c"><span id="zw-12bf62e94237NMxnQ3916c">Supercomputing is largely a solved problem...do a regression analysis on the variables on the Top 500 sometime. Primarily it's a function of the number of cores. I've told people in my own workplace - you want a machine on the Top 500 then write me a cheque - making a supercomputer isn't the feat of skill or engineering that it was in the days of Cray. This doesn't even touch on what the hell you use these things for the problem space for parallel processing is clearly smaller than that of serial processing. Add to that the assertion that the number of useful applications drops off steeply as you add more cores (at some point you are left with only the "embarrassingly parallel" ones) and creating the largest supercomputer in the world is akin to saying you are creating the least useful computer in the world. Not to mention probably one of the least power efficient, highest maintenance costs, etc.. 【我相信这哥们说的是事实】</span></li>
